        <p>
          I'm a self-taught JavaScript developer and Shopify Partner in my third year of building custom solutions for 
          eCommerce businesses. With a strong foundation in Shopify theme customization, metafields, and Shopify 
          APIs, I specialize in turning design into code and creating tailored user experiences that convert.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work at a start-up in Kenya where I've grown from a junior developer into a dependable team player, thanks 
          to a supportive mentorship culture. I'm passionate about problem-solving and constantly deepening my skills 
          â€” from building binary arithmetic calculators to exploring AI-powered real-time transcription tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy morning runs and building community with fellow developers. I'm working 
          toward becoming a top Shopify app developer and building a meaningful impact through technology.
